# Seddit

This is my attempt at a clone of Reddit. 

## Set up

Simply fork/clone this repo and run:
```
bundle
```

Then to create the tables run:
```
rails db:create

rails db:migrate
```

Then you'll be ready to go!

## Running server

To run your local server run:
```
rails s
```

## Running tests

To run tests:
```
rspec
```
