# Seddit
This is my attempt at a clone of Reddit. 
## Set up
First, fork/clone this repo.
To install all the gems and dependencies run:
```
bundle
```
Then to create the tables run:
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```
Then you'll be ready to go!
## Running server
To run your local server run:
```
rails s
```
Then visit localhost:3000 to view the app.
## Running tests
To run tests:
```
rspec
```
